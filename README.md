# gasless-transaction-files
the main source code for the challenge round 1

Here is the youtube video link (the video has been unlisted due to security reasons): https://youtu.be/HVf_lA9WEp0
1. The video will explain the working of teh project in general with reference to the submitted zip file
2. There has been additional documentation provided in the main repository which can be accessed for further knowledge
3. There is also some deprecated files, if they exist, it is marked/renamed as "[FILE NAME]_deprecated[.extension]"

This code has been made using;
A. Solidity ver8.0.0+ (or higher), 
B. npm 18.0.0+ (or higher),
C. OpenZeppelin Contracts (Â© 2025 Zeppelin Group Ltd)

Note on use of API Keys and Transaction IDs:
1. All the keys that have been used will either be delisted/deprecated or deleted(if allowed). Necessary comments and documentation, along with video, explains the replacement of the same testing keys with user defined keys and API URLs.
2. The token IDs or the Private key, will no longer be usable, or will stand deprecated and null, due to security reasons. The Private key ID that has been provided belongs to seventhsense and all rights of uses are reserved with seventhsense.
3. It will be highly appreciated if the judges/evaluators maintain the secrecy of such API IDs and Private Keys, as they are highly vunerable targets, obviously.
4. It is highly recommended to first edit the token IDs/ Private Relay key/ API URL before starting the project, as doing it after deploying will create unnecessary trouble, (or as the evaluators find it right).

There might certain segements of the URL that may need to be changed, so the commit timeline may get extended, due to third party dependencies. 

Detailed explanation of the working of the code has been provided in the Documentation that has been added to the main repository of the https://github.com/seventhsense-adwaitbhardwaj/gasless-transaction-files
